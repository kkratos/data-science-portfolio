# Data Science Portfolio - Kamal Patel

This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. This portfolio also contains my skills, and certificates. It is updated on the regular basis.

## Projects

In this project, I performed pattern analysis and visualization of 2.8 million US vehicle accidents over a 9-year period (2016-2022). Investigated the impact of environmental factors on traffic behavior and identified key safety risks.

In this project I analyzed payment behavior of the user and applied various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM and XGBoost to detect consumers who will default the loan. Tuning LightGBM model with AutoML and PyCaret resulted into the highest AUC score of 0.74 without feature engineering nearing the top score of 0.79 on the kaggle competetion. More work with advanced statistical methods need to be applied to improve the model score.

In this project I have used models such as LSTM to predict the engine failure 50 cycles ahead of its time, and currently exploring feature engineering using sensitivity analysis and shap values.

## Micro Projects

- ### Statistics and Machine Learning
  - [Chi-Square Test](https://github.com/kkratos/Assessing-Campaign-Performance-Using-Chi-Square-Test/blob/main/Chi-Square-Test.ipynb) : In this file I Applied chi-square for Independence using SciPy library to assess the performance of two types of campaign to optimize marketing spend to promote a new delivery service for grocery store.
  - [Predict Student Performance](https://github.com/kkratos/Predict-Student-Performance): The goal of this project was to understand the influence of the parents background, test preparation, and various other variables on the students math and english score.
